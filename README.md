# Top5AssociatedIngredients

This project was developed to demonstrate one of the projects I worked on at Baudville Brands. The ideas is that you can enter ingredients and the top 5 ingredients associated with the queried ingredients based on recipes from the below API.

API: http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/

To test edit the following list *enter_ingredients_here*:
  enter_ingredients_here = ['spinach', 'garlic']

TODO: 
  1. Add GUI
